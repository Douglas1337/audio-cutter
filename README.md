# audio-cutter
Cut many audio files(mp3 or wav) at same point.
This program extract a fragment of a many audio files located in the same directory.
 
This program works was only teste in Linux Operational Systems, but I think this works fine in Windows OS.
 
PROBABLY YOU NEED TO INSTALL ffmpeg in our system: "sudo apt install ffmpeg" to this program works fine!
